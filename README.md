## 🚀 **Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to analyze historical flight data and uncover meaningful trends related to:
- **Flight Delays:** Identifying key factors contributing to delays and patterns across airports, routes, and seasons.
- **Passenger Demographics:** Analyzing passenger distributions based on age, class, and travel purpose.
- **Operational Insights:** Delivering actionable insights for improving flight schedules, resource planning, and customer satisfaction.

## 📊 **Tableau Dashboards**

The project includes interactive dashboards with the following features:

1. **Flight Delay Analysis:**  
   - Heatmaps for seasonal trends in delays.
   - Delay patterns across airlines, airports, and routes.
   - Comparison between weather-related and operational delays.

2. **Passenger Demographics:**  
   - Visual breakdown of passenger age groups and class preferences.
   - Geographic distribution of passengers across destinations.
   - Analysis of peak travel times by demographic segments.

3. **Operational Efficiency Dashboards:**  
   - Flight performance metrics (on-time percentage, average delay times).
   - Recommendations for operational improvements based on insights.
